            <p>
            	<div>eSign for Odoo is an extraordinary concept to facilitate the paperless working in an office. It helps in reducing cost, save time as you don’t need to go to each and every person to get a signature and even reduces manual errors as everything is automated. Apart from all these benefits, it also ensures security of the document as it is sent to the right person.</div> 
                <br/>
				<div>Odoo, by default provides an out of the box eSign app which sends the document to each and every person listed on it at the same time. This might not be a desirable situation for processes where the document needs a signature in a flow of authority.</div>
                <br/>
				<div>Let’s take example of Sales Department, if Sale Order is to be shipped, a signature of Sales manager and Warehouse manager is required. If the document is sent to both at the same time, Warehouse manager will sign it not know if the Sale manager has authorised it or not. Logically, Sales Manager should sign it first and then only it should go to the warehouse manager. This procedure ensures that everything runs in sync.</div> 
                <br/>
				<div>Odoo, by default does not provide this feature. We have made this app to bridge the gap between that problem. eSign for Odoo based on Priority is an app that assign priorities to the signature that are required first. It will send signature request to the next person only when it completed by person with higher priority and verified by the admin.</div> 
                <br/>
				<div>This app will helps you assign sequences/stages to the signature based on your requirement and it will send the request to next person once the previous one is completed. This is highly useful in manufacturing units where production needs to be approved based on the authority. For example, a new production batch might need to be first approved by the CEO for the Production manager to start the production and then by the Wareshouse manager to dispatch the required raw materials. There can be multiple cases like this based on the requirements of your business.</div> 
                <br/>
				<div>Odoo eSign based on priorites will help you manage your business and documents in a flexible way. This app is built-on the default esign app to ensure easy UX and faster turnaround. Get this app now and go over the limitation of default eSign app of Odo and start managing your documents the way you always wanted to.</div>
